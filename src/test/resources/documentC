Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.
What have you done with those plans?
We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....
I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun!
She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador?
The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
